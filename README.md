## About

You can find many libraries and modules ready to build bots on Telegram, but none of them cover the basic functionalities that are almost indispensable, such as creating a help menu automatically from commands, registering users, generating a log in the Telegram administrator and others. The purpose of this library is to fill these gaps and allow Telegram bot developers to quickly create powerful, stable and secure bots in just a few lines of code. This work is still in its early stages, but I invite you to help me explore and conquer the fascinating world of Telegram bots by collaborating and using this library.

The orginal article in English is here: [A Python Framework for Telegram Bots - DEV Community](https://dev.to/gersonfreire/a-python-framework-for-telegram-bots-238f)

The orginal article in Portuguese is here:  [Biblioteca em n√≠vel de aplica√ß√£o para criar bots no Telegram ü§ñ ¬∑ telegram ¬∑ TabNews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/telegram/biblioteca-de-nivel-de-aplicativo-para-criar-bots-no-telegram)

## How it works

Basically, we build a class called TlgBotFwk, which inherits from the Application class, implemented by the telegram.ext library, provided by the python-telegram-bot package, version 21 or greater ([https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)). In this child class, we implement some default methods to handle the universal commands /start, /help and other unrecognized commands. However, the developer can implement their own command handlers without losing the built-in functionality. I recommend reading the source code for more details. I also recommend Python 3.12 version.

## Usage

To use this class, just create a simple script with bellow lines of code and the bot will run:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
  
    app = TlgBotFwk()  
    app.run()
```

Don¬¥t forget to create a .env file, because the framework will load settings like Telegram Token and Admin user Id from it. You will find a sample.env file on project root, with this content, which could be got as explained bellow

```
DEFAULT_BOT_TOKEN=<PUT YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE> 
DEFAULT_BOT_OWNER=<PUT HERE YOUR TELEGRAM ID> 
```

To get a Telegram bot token from BotFather to use in a Python bot script, follow these steps:

1. **Start a Chat with BotFather** :

* Open Telegram and search for ‚ÄúBotFather‚Äù.
* Start a conversation by clicking the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button.

1. **Create a New Bot** :

* Type `/newbot` and send the message.
* BotFather will ask for a name for your bot. Choose a name that ends with ‚ÄúBot‚Äù, like ‚ÄúMyAwesomeBot‚Äù.

1. **Choose a Username** :

* After naming the bot, BotFather will ask for a unique username for your bot. It must end in ‚Äúbot‚Äù (e.g., `AwesomeBot` or `MyAwesomeBot_bot`).

1. **Receive the Token** :

* Once you‚Äôve provided a valid username, BotFather will generate a token for your bot.
* The token will look something like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`.

1. **Save the Token** :

* This token is essential for accessing the Telegram Bot API. Copy and save it somewhere secure, as you‚Äôll need it to authenticate your bot in your Python script.

1. **Using the Token in .env** :

* In your .env file, you can use this token replacing it on `<PUT YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE>`.

To get your telegram Id and replace `<PUT YOUR TELEGRAM ID HERE>`, follow these steps:

 **Start a Chat with a Bot that Reveals User ID** :

* Search for a bot like [userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or any other similar bot in Telegram.
* Start the chat by clicking "Start."
* Get the number after "Id:" and replace it on .env
