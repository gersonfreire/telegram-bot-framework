`success_url = requests.utils.quote(success_url, safe='')     `

This line of code is using the `quote` function from the `requests.utils` module to URL-encode the `success_url` string. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **`requests.utils.quote`**: This function is used to percent-encode a URL or a string. It is similar to `urllib.parse.quote` but is provided by the `requests` library.
2. **`success_url`**: This is the string that you want to URL-encode.
3. **`safe=''`**: This parameter specifies characters that should not be percent-encoded. By passing an empty string, you are indicating that no characters should be considered safe, and all special characters should be percent-encoded.

### Example

If `success_url` is `"https://example.com/path?query=hello world"`, the `quote` function will convert it to `"https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fpath%3Fquery%3Dhello%20world"`.

### Code Explanation

```python
import requests

success_url = "https://example.com/path?query=hello world"
encoded_url = requests.utils.quote(success_url, safe='')
print(encoded_url)
```

This will output:

```
https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fpath%3Fquery%3Dhello%20world
```

This ensures that the URL is properly encoded for safe transmission over the internet.
