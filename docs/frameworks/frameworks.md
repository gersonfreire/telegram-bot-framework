Here are three frameworks available on GitHub that wrap the `python-telegram-bot` module:

1. **[Telegram Framework by alvarogzp](https://github.com/alvarogzp/telegram-bot-framework)**:

   - This Python framework is designed to simplify the creation of Telegram bots. It is event-based, allowing developers to configure specific actions for various events, such as commands or group entries. The framework supports Python 3 and offers features like i18n support, error handling, and logging. It also includes examples and a set of default configurations to get started quickly.
2. **[python-telegram-bot-ext](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot-ext)**:

   - This extension library enhances the basic `python-telegram-bot` library by adding advanced features like state management, reusable components, and a higher-level API. It is aimed at developers who need more sophisticated bot functionality beyond what the core library offers.
3. **[PTBManager](https://github.com/fenrirthviti/PTBManager)**:

   - PTBManager is another framework that builds on `python-telegram-bot`. It includes tools for managing long-running conversations, handling complex command structures, and integrating with external APIs. This framework is especially useful for bots that need to maintain state across multiple user interactions.

These frameworks can provide a more structured and feature-rich environment for building Telegram bots using Python.
