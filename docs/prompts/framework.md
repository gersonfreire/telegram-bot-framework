I'll help you create a comprehensive Telegram bot framework with the features you described.

Python Telegram Bot Framework

I've created a complete, production-ready Telegram bot framework with the following features:

1. Modular architecture with separate components for core functionality, handlers, and settings
2. Automatic command handling based on YAML configuration
3. Built-in /start, /help, and /settings commands
4. Environment variable support for sensitive data
5. Comprehensive logging
6. Easy extensibility
7. Type hints and proper error handling

To use the bot:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Telegram bot token
2. Copy `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and customize the commands
3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
4. Run `src/main.py`

The framework is designed to be easily extended with new commands and features while maintaining clean code organization and separation of concerns.
