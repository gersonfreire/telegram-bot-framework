Yes, there are higher-level frameworks that further abstract the functionality provided by the libraries like `python-telegram-bot`, `Telethon`, `Telegram.Bot`, and `Telegraf`. These frameworks aim to make building Telegram bots even easier by providing more structured and opinionated tools:

1. **PTB-Wizard**:

   - **Description**: A high-level wrapper specifically built on top of `python-telegram-bot`. It provides tools and decorators to simplify common tasks like command handling, argument parsing, and state management, making it easier to build complex bots quickly.
   - **GitHub**: [PTB-Wizard](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/ptb-wizard)
2. **aiogram**:

   - **Description**: Although not an over-wrap of `python-telegram-bot`, `aiogram` is another Python framework that simplifies working with the Telegram Bot API. It offers higher-level abstractions and is asynchronous, making it ideal for more complex applications.
   - **GitHub**: [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram)
3. **Pyrogram**:

   - **Description**: Pyrogram is an elegant, easy-to-use Telegram client library that wraps both the Telegram Bot API and the MTProto API. While it directly competes with `Telethon`, it provides a high-level API that can be easier to work with for certain tasks.

4. **BotX**:

   - **Description**: A Python framework built on top of `Telethon`, `python-telegram-bot`, and other libraries. It offers high-level abstractions for creating complex bots with plugins, handlers, and middlewares, and it integrates well with multiple messaging platforms beyond Telegram.
   - **GitHub**: [BotX](https://github.com/botx-hub/botx)

These frameworks further simplify bot development by adding additional layers of abstraction and convenience, allowing developers to focus more on the business logic of their bots rather than the intricacies of the underlying Telegram API.
