The provided code snippet does not explicitly specify which chat bot the data should be sent to. The `window.Telegram.WebApp.sendData` function is part of the Telegram Web Apps API, which is used to interact with Telegram bots from a web application.

To understand how the data is sent to a specific chat bot, you need to consider the following:

1. **Telegram Web Apps Context**: The `window.Telegram.WebApp` object is available when your web app is opened inside the Telegram app. This context is provided by Telegram when the web app is launched from a bot.
2. **Bot Configuration**: When you configure your Telegram bot, you specify the URL of your web app. This configuration is done using the BotFather on Telegram. When a user interacts with your bot and opens the web app, Telegram provides the necessary context to the web app, including the bot's information.
3. **sendData Function**: The `sendData` function sends data back to the bot that opened the web app. The bot receives this data through the `web_app_data` event.

Here is a high-level overview of how it works:

1. **Bot Configuration**: You configure your bot to open your web app using a specific URL.
2. **User Interaction**: A user interacts with your bot and opens the web app.
3. **Web App Context**: Telegram provides the `window.Telegram.WebApp` object to your web app, which includes the context of the bot and the chat.
4. **Sending Data**: When the user submits the form, the `sendData` function sends the data back to the bot.

To summarize, the connection between your web app and the specific chat bot is established through the Telegram Web Apps API and the bot configuration done via BotFather. The `sendData` function sends data back to the bot that opened the web app, ensuring the data is sent to the correct bot.

If you need to see the full context or configuration, you would typically look at how the bot is set up and how the web app is launched from the bot.
