The error "Inline keyboard button url 'http://localhost:5000' is invalid: wrong http url" you are encountering in your Telegram bot is due to the fact that Telegram does not allow URLs with localhost or any loopback IP address as they aren't accessible from the internet.

To fix this issue, you need to replace the URL with a publicly accessible URL. If you are developing and testing your application locally, you can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.

Here's an example of how you can use ngrok to expose your local server:

1. Download and install ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).
2. Start your local server (for example, `flask run` if you are using Flask).
3. In a new terminal, run `ngrok http 5000` to expose your local server. This will give you a publicly accessible URL.
4. Update the `WEB_APP_URL` in your bot code to the ngrok URL.

For example, if ngrok gives you the URL `http://12345.ngrok.io`, your updated code will look like this:

```python
WEB_APP_URL = "http://12345.ngrok.io"

# Define the /app command handler
async def app(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:
    try:
        keyboard = [
            [InlineKeyboardButton("Open Web App", url=WEB_APP_URL)]
        ]
        reply_markup = InlineKeyboardMarkup(keyboard)
        await update.message.reply_text('Click the button below to open the web app:', reply_markup=reply_markup)
    except Exception as e:
        # "Inline keyboard button url 'http://localhost:5000' is invalid: wrong http url"
        logger.error(f"Error in /app command: {e}")
        await update.message.reply_text('An error occurred while processing your request.')
```

This should resolve the issue and allow the Telegram bot to work correctly with the web app button.
